# # Welcome!
# Below, we will learn to implement and train a policy to play atari-pong, using only the pixels as input. We will use convolutional neural nets, multiprocessing, and pytorch to implement and train our policy. Let's get started!

# In[1]:


# install package for displaying animation
get_ipython().system('pip install JSAnimation')

# custom utilies for displaying animation, collecting rollouts and more
import pong_utils

get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# check which device is being used. 
# I recommend disabling gpu until you've made sure that the code runs
device = pong_utils.device
print("using device: ",device)


# In[2]:


# render ai gym environment
import gym
import time

# PongDeterministic does not contain random frameskip
# so is faster to train than the vanilla Pong-v4 environment
env = gym.make('PongDeterministic-v4')

print("List of available actions: ", env.unwrapped.get_action_meanings())

# we will only use the actions 'RIGHTFIRE' = 4 and 'LEFTFIRE" = 5
# the 'FIRE' part ensures that the game starts again after losing a life
# the actions are hard-coded in pong_utils.py


# # Preprocessing
# To speed up training, we can simplify the input by cropping the images and use every other pixel
# 
# 

# In[3]:


import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# show what a preprocessed image looks like
env.reset()
_, _, _, _ = env.step(0)
# get a frame after 20 steps
for _ in range(20):
    frame, _, _, _ = env.step(1)

plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.imshow(frame)
plt.title('original image')

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.title('preprocessed image')

# 80 x 80 black and white image
plt.imshow(pong_utils.preprocess_single(frame), cmap='Greys')
plt.show()


# # Policy
# 
# ## Exercise 1: Implement your policy
#  
# Here, we define our policy. The input is the stack of two different frames (which captures the movement), and the output is a number $P_{\rm right}$, the probability of moving left. Note that $P_{\rm left}= 1-P_{\rm right}$

# In[4]:


import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F



# set up a convolutional neural net
# the output is the probability of moving right
# P(left) = 1-P(right)
class Policy(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self):
        super(Policy, self).__init__()

        # outputsize = (inputsize - kernel_size + stride)/stride

        # output = 20x20 here
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(2, 1, kernel_size=4, stride=4)
        self.size=1*20*20

        # 1 fully connected layer

# we use the adam optimizer with learning rate 2e-4
# optim.SGD is also possible
import torch.optim as optim
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=1e-4)


# # Game visualization
# pong_utils contain a play function given the environment and a policy. An optional preprocess function can be supplied. Here we define a function that plays a game and shows learning progress

# In[5]:


pong_utils.play(env, policy, time=200) 
# try to add the option "preprocess=pong_utils.preprocess_single"
# to see what the agent sees


# # Function Definitions
# Here you will define key functions for training. 
# 
# ## Exercise 2: write your own function for training
# (what I call scalar function is the same as policy_loss up to a negative sign)
# 
# ### PPO
# Later on, you'll implement the PPO algorithm as well, and the scalar function is given by
# $\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_t \min\left\{R_{t}^{\rm future}\frac{\pi_{\theta'}(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)},R_{t}^{\rm future}{\rm clip}_{\epsilon}\!\left(\frac{\pi_{\theta'}(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)}\right)\right\}$
# 
# the ${\rm clip}_\epsilon$ function is implemented in pytorch as ```torch.clamp(ratio, 1-epsilon, 1+epsilon)```

# In[6]:


def clipped_surrogate(policy, old_probs, states, actions, rewards,
                      discount = 0.995, epsilon=0.1, beta=0.01):
