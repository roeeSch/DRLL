# ### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces
# In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of `+0.1` is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
# The observation space consists of `33` variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm.  Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.  Every entry in the action vector must be a number between `-1` and `1`.
# Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.

# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('Number of agents:', num_agents)

# size of each action
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size

# examine the state space 
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]
print('There are {} agents. Each observes a state with length: {}'.format(states.shape[0], state_size))
print('The state for the first agent looks like:', states[0])



# ### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment
# 
# In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.
# 
# Once this cell is executed, you will watch the agent's performance, if it selects an action at random with each time step.  A window should pop up that allows you to observe the agent, as it moves through the environment.  
# 
# Of course, as part of the project, you'll have to change the code so that the agent is able to use its experience to gradually choose better actions when interacting with the environment!
